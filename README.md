## Background
This application was developed for the [Turing School of Software and Design's](https://frontend.turing.edu/) Module 2 group project. The project, [Fitlit](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/fitlit-part-one-agile.html), challenged teams to store, manipulate, and display users' fitness data, accessed from a series of APIs, using a test-driven development approach.

The app presents users with a dashboard of their latest daily and all-time fitness metrics across three categories - activity, sleep, and hydration - and allows the user to compare their statistics against benchmarks of all users and to view dynamically-created infographics of their metrics over the past week.
