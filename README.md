## Project Specification
[Project Spec and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/fitlit-part-one-agile.html)

## Background
This application was developed for the [Turing School of Software and Design's](https://frontend.turing.edu/) Module 2 group project. The project, [Fitlit](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/fitlit-part-one-agile.html), challenged teams to store, manipulate, and display users' fitness data, accessed from a series of APIs, using a test-driven development approach.

The app presents users with a dashboard of their latest daily and all-time fitness metrics across three categories - activity, sleep, and hydration - and allows the user to compare their statistics against benchmarks of all users and to view dynamically-created infographics of their metrics over the past week.

## Wins and Challanges

### Wins:
- Successfully implemented use of fetch API to fetch data asynchronously.
- Using technology from third party libraries from both chart.js & date.js to enhance the UI experience
- Utilizing gitHub project board to divide tasks, update design, and submit code review and receive feedback from teammates 
- Making application 100% accessible via Lighthouse audit

### Challenges:
- Uniformly deciding on a layout and design. We remained open to everyones ideas via frequent communication, extensive planning and research and continued to update our wireframing and project board as the application progressed for problems that arised.
