## Project Specification
[Project Spec and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/fitlit-part-one-agile.html)

## Background
This application was developed for the [Turing School of Software and Design's](https://frontend.turing.edu/) Module 2 group project. The project, [Fitlit](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/fitlit-part-one-agile.html), challenged teams to store, manipulate, and display users' fitness data, accessed from a series of APIs, using a test-driven development approach.

The app presents users with a dashboard of their latest daily and all-time fitness metrics across three categories - activity, sleep, and hydration - and allows the user to compare their statistics against benchmarks of all users and to view dynamically-created infographics of their metrics over the past week.

## Wins and Challanges

### Wins:
- Successfully implemented the fetch API to fetch data asynchronously.
- Utilized third-party libraries, such as chart.js and date.js, to enhance the user interface.
- Utilized GitHub project boards to organize tasks, update designs, and receive feedback from team members.
- Achieved 100% accessibility for the application through a Lighthouse audit.
- Utilized test-driven development to ensure high code quality.
- Collaborated effectively with the team.
- Resolved merge conflicts efficiently.

### Challenges:
- Struggled to uniformly decide on a layout and design, but overcame this challenge through frequent communication, extensive planning and research, and ongoing updates to wireframes and project boards.
- Had difficulty understanding and implementing fetch calls.
- Faced a learning curve with both chart.js and date.js third-party libraries, but successfully implemented methods to display user data.
